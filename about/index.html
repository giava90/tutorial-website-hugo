<p>I am a senior researcher at the Chair of Ecosystem Management, ETH Zurich, where I am exploring trade-offs in using wood for construction by analyzing the supply chain.
My focus study is at two level: <a href="mainwood.ch">Swiss</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl6-2024-climate-01-5">European</a>.
Before joining this group, I worked as a post-doc and obtained a Doctorate in Science in 2019 at the Chair of System Design, ETH Zurich.
During my formation, I completed the Part III of the Mathematical Tripos from the University of Cambridge and received a Master in Theoretical Physics from Sapienza University of Rome.</p>
<p>My research interests lie in understanding the determinants and effects of cooperation in socio-economic systems. He studies <a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0117-5">how collaborations are established among firms or scientists</a> to create new knowledge. He also investigates how the knowledge of these actors, in turn, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00191-018-0569-1">defines their collaborations</a>. To capture this feedback, I combine statistical analysis of patent and publication data with agent-based models. In recent years, I have worked extensively on how psychological and cognitive processes can foster but also hamper the emergence of cooperation. To this end, I have developed mathematical models and experiments leveraging game theory and complex systems theory.</p>
<p>I published papers in major peer-review journals. I am a member of the editorial board for the journal Social Network Analysis and Mining and has been a guest editor of the journal Advances of Complex Systems. I am also an active reviewer for various venues, including Journal of Informetrics, European Physics Journal - Data Science, and Physica A, Physical Review E.</p>
<p>On top of the research activity, I am been teaching the course Agent-Based Modelling of Social Systems and Understanding Complexity through Systems Approaches.</p>
